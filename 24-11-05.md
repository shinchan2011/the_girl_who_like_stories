I actually have deleted the GitHub page link. It must be showing a 404 error now.
I am sorry ki maine ye link apni bio mai daala, mujhe nhi daalna chahiye tha. Pata nhi mai kya karoon khudka yaar, maine pehle hi kaha tha ki you should not read what i write and that i dont wanna cause you any trouble aur issi wajah se to I asked you to block me. Aur ab pata nhi kyon mai phirse wahi saari chizen dohra rah, phirse terko pareshan kr rha.
Pata nhi kyon hoon mai aisa yaar, why I can’t just let things be. I wish I could just sit with my own thoughts, handle them on my own without feeling the urge to share them, only to regret it later. But I promise you, now that the GitHub page is deleted, you won’t have to see any of this again. I won’t let my confusions touch you anymore. Because I know dragging you into these things that arent yours to carry is not fair. And now that the link is gone, I can finally be sure that you’ll have the distance you need, free from the weight of my words.

I made you a birthday note btw. In front, it has a Shinchan and the same quote as last year saying, "I wish you wake up with the same smile everyday." And on the back, it has Cookie and Nugget with Happy Birthday written on it and a quote saying, "May your birthday be just like you."
I made this note a few days ago, was planning to give you yesterday only. Socha tha ki Lab sbse pehle jaunga aur tumhare 'PC-11' par jakar note rakh dunga. Par tum to mujhse bhi pehle pahunch gyi aur mai kuch kar hi na saka. Then I thought maybe I would give you today after class, par classes to cancel honi hi thi.
I was in the library yesterday and also had that keychain which I bought this summer, was thinking of giving it to you, socha ki library me hi kisi shelf par rakh doon aur like last year tumhe bata doon by bio or status maybe, par mann nhi maana. So I left the keychain on the table there. It’s probably by the librarian’s desk now, I guess.

I think I have to wish you here only. I know you are not gonna read it par koi baat nahi.

Happy birthday pranjali!
