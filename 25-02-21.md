Hi,
Ek story likhi thi waise, socha ky apta tumhe bhi sunne ki iccha ho.

Darsh never understood why people said time flies. For him, every day felt painfully slow. Wake up, go to college, sit in lectures, go home, repeat.

And then, there was Megha.

She wasn’t someone who stood out in a crowd. She wasn’t the loudest, the smartest, or the most popular. But to Darsh, she was different.

Maybe it was the way she always sat by the window in the library-cum-cafe, lost in a book. Or how she scribbled in the margins of her notebook, her pen moving like it was racing against her thoughts.

They weren’t friends. They barely talked. But he noticed her, always.

One rainy afternoon, as Darsh walked past her usual spot, he finally asked, “What do you always write?”

She looked up, her dark eyes widening behind her glasses. For a second, he thought she’d ignore him. Then, after a pause, she said, “Just thoughts. Things I want to remember.”

In her hands was a worn copy of "Pride and Prejudice".

"Do you always read that book?" asked Darsh.

"It’s my favorite. It feels like coming home." whispered Megha.

He wanted to ask more. What kind of thoughts? Why write them here? But she had already gone back to her notebook.

The next day, she wasn’t there.

Darsh told himself he didn’t care. But his eyes kept drifting to the empty window seat.

When she returned a week later, he pretended to read a textbook nearby. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw her tear a page from her notebook, fold it into a tiny square, and tuck it into the library’s dusty copy of "Jane Eyre".

After she left, he pulled out the book. The note read:

“Day 47: The boy who never talks finally did. I wish I’d said more.”

His face burned.

Weeks passed. Notes kept appearing.

“Day 52: Rain makes the library smell like old paper and loneliness.”

“Day 61: He wears the same blue sweater every Monday. I wonder why.”

Darsh started leaving replies, tucked between the same pages:

“It’s my lucky sweater.”

“The rain stopped. You’re back.”

They never spoke. But the notes grew longer, funnier, softer.

One evening, he found a sketch, she’d left a doodle of him, his hair sticking up like he’d been electrocuted. He laughed so loud the librarian shushed him.

The next day, he left her a chocolate bar. She left him a pressed maple leaf.

Seasons changed. The library’s windows frosted over. Megha wrote:

“Day 109: I’m leaving next month. Dad got a job in another city.”

Darsh’s chest tightened. He scribbled: “Will you keep writing notes?”

She replied: “Only if you read them.”

..........

On her final day in the city, Megha ran to the library, her backpack slamming against her shoulders. The train station clock ticked in her head, 45 minutes left. She had to leave a note. He’d check their spot. He had to.

She yanked out "Jane Eyre" from their usual shelf, the one with the torn spine, the one they’d hidden notes in for months.

But the book wasn’t there.

Her breath quickened. She scanned the shelves, fingers trembling. Where was it? Had someone borrowed it? Thrown it away? The library clock hissed: 30 minutes.

“Please, please,” she whispered, tears blurring her vision.

Then she saw it, "Pride and Prejudice", sitting on a cart of returned books. Her book. The one she had told Darsh was her favourite.

She grabbed it, scribbling furiously on a scrap of paper:
“Meet me here at the library every year on this day. Just in case. – Megha.”

She tucked the note into a random page and slammed the book onto the shelf.

As she sprinted to the station, raindrops mixed with her tears. He’ll find it. He has to.

..........

Darsh arrived an hour later, soaked from the rain. The library was quiet, hollow.

He went straight to "Jane Eyre". There was no note. He flipped through every page. Nothing.

“She didn’t even say goodbye,” he muttered, fists clenched.

He stormed out, kicking a pebble across the wet pavement. Ghosted. After all those notes, all those laughs.

He never glanced at "Pride and Prejudice".

He was so out of his mind that he started keeping himself busy, studies, lectures, movie anything that keep his mind off her. After college he threw himself into work, wore suits instead of blue sweaters. Life blurred into meetings and deadlines.



---Fifteen Years Later---

The café smelled of coffee and bread, just like always. Darsh sat by the window, staring at the rain, watching people walk past. He hadn’t been back in years, but today, something pulled him here. Maybe because it was the first time after years that he was here in the home city during monsoon.

His eyes drifted to the bookshelf in the corner. A faded copy of "Pride and Prejudice" sat there and suddenly he remembered that it was Megha's favourite. His chest tightened.

He pulled it out. A note fluttered to the floor.

“Meet me here at the library every year on this day. Just in case. – Megha.”

His hands shook and he froze.

He didn’t look up until he heard a laugh he hadn’t heard in years.

Megha.

There she was, tucked into a corner booth, reading Pride and Prejudice. Her hair was shorter now, with a little hint of gray, but her fingers still drummed the table as she read. Darsh’s heart squeezed.

He walked to her table. She didn’t look up.

“Still reading that?” he said, his voice shaky.

Megha froze. She lifted her gaze, and for a heartbeat, Darsh saw the girl she’d been: messy hair, bright eyes, ink smudged on her cheek. Then she blinked, and the woman in front of him smiled softly.

“Darsh,” she said. “You look… older.”

He laughed, but it sounded sad. “You don’t.”

They sat quietly. The café buzzed around them, but between them, the air felt still.

“You still come here?” he asked.

“When I miss the past,” she said, closing the book. Her hand brushed the table, and he saw a wedding ring.

Married. Of course. He’d missed it.

“This place hasn’t changed,” he said, looking around.

Megha raised an eyebrow. “Really?”

He looked closer. The walls were the same green, but now hung with photos of strangers. The old barista was gone; a young girl with pink hair worked now. And Megha, her wrist had a thin white scar he’d never seen.

When did that happen?

“You never wrote back,” she said gently.

His chest hurt. “Life got… busy.”

She touched her teacup. “I left you one last note. In "Pride and Prejudice".”

He stared at his hands. He’d never checked.

“I looked for you,” she said. “When my dad died.”

His breath caught. “When?”

“7 years ago.”

He remembered her dad, a quiet man who’d once given him a spare umbrella in a storm.

“I’m sorry,” he whispered.

She nodded. “I sat here after the funeral. Waited for you to walk in, to say something funny and stupid. To cheer me up.” She paused. “You didn’t.”

Darsh wanted to scream at his past self. But time had slipped away, quiet as the rain.

“Do you ever think,” he said, “what if we’d noticed?”

Megha smiled, but her eyes were sad. “Every day.”

She stood, checking her watch. “I need to go. My daughter’s piano recital starts soon.”

Daughter. The word felt like a punch.

He walked her outside. The rain had stopped. Megha turned to him, and for a moment, he saw the girl who’d drawn silly sketches, who’d pressed maple leaves into books.

She turned through her book and pulled out a folded note, the edges were torn, the paper gone soft at the creases, and gave it to him. “Goodbye, Darsh,” she said.

He watched her leave, her shadow getting smaller until she disappeared.

The note said:

“Day 1: Saw a boy today who looks at the world like it’s a puzzle he can’t solve. I hope he never does.”
