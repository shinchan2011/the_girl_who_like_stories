Hey!
Dev keh raha tha that you were asking about me. That you still wanna stay friends.

Ab kaise kahoon yaar. I.... well I was just going through some old texts and couldn't help but smile at them. I have realized that asking you to block me was not a great idea I guess. Pata nahi mera mann karta hai ki tujhpar gussa dikhaun, chillaoon tujhpar lekin phir khayal aata hai ki kyon. Akhir teri koi galti hi nahi. Par khash ki hoti kyonki yesab jo mere andar chal raha mujhe ye bahar nikalna hai. Kyon hai zindagi aisi yaar. Kyon nahi chal sakti mere hisab se. Yaar mai tujhe uske sath dekhta hoon to pata nhi kyon mujhe galat sa lagta hai sabhkuch. Vo sapne maine dekhe hai. Ki tu mera hath pakde, ki tu mujhe dekhkar khush ho, apni baatein mujhe batae.... aur ye sari chizen vo jee raha hai aur mai nahi aur mai kuch kar bhi nahi sakta.

I know you want me back as your friend but please smjh yaar, nahi ho payega mujhse, aur himmat nahi hai mujhme. Apne dost banne ke baad mai phirse vahi saari chizen dohrane lagunga, tujhe baar baar text karne lagunga. Tu pareshan ho jayegi mujhse.

The thing is I really miss our conversation and I really miss you. But I respect you and your decisions as well.
And I wish you never unblock me.
