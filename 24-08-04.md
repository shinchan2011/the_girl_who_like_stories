Hey its your papa's birthday tomorrow right?
Well wish him a happy birthday from my side too.

You know why I remember all the things. That the watch you wear is a very close one and that your father gave it to you when you were in 5th. That you really wanted a rose on your last birthday but nobody gave you. Ki tum aksar gaano aur shayariyon me khudko dhundne ki koshish karti ho. Ki tum jitna dikhati ho tumhe usse kayi zyada gussa aata hai, ki tumhare cooler me paani poore 4 mint me bhar jaata hai.

And honestly if you ask me, I am terrible with dates. I mean school me history ke dates mujhe kabhi yaad nahi hue, par phir bhi ab najane kyon mujhe tumhara birthday, tumhare puri family ka birthday aur yahan tak ki tumhare parents ki wedding anniversary tak bhi yaad hai. Aur aisa kyon. Kyonki aisa hi to hota hai, log gaur karte hai. Sab nahi lekin sirf vo jinhe fark padta hai. Tumhare baat karne na karne se nahi but from your existence.

And after all isn't it what everyone desires? To be seen, to have their efforts acknowledged, to be understood, and to be cared for? The only difference here is that you don't look to me for these things.
