Chapter 9: The King’s Dilemma
The king, though a wise and kind man, couldn’t let his daughter marry a commoner. He wanted the best for his daughter, and many princes from other kingdoms were coming with offers of marriage. The king thought it was best for the princess to marry someone of her status.
But Sofia was unhappy. She didn’t want to marry anyone else. She loved Liam, the simple boy who had won her heart with his kindness and love. The king saw his daughter’s sadness and began to worry. He loved her dearly and wanted her to be happy, but he didn’t know how to reconcile his duty with her happiness.
