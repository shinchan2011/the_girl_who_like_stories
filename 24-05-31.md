Do you ever just want to sit next to me and listen to whatever I say, only because you wanna know how my day was? Cause I do.
Since the day we lost touch, I've been trying to keep track of everything I want to tell you, from every big event to every little thing like what I ate today or what's been on my mind. But I know I will only talk about the big stuff at the end because, you know, it's too hard to go through all the little things. However, these little things are what truly make up life.

It's been 192 days since we lost touch, 536 days since we officially met, and 1654 days since I first saw you. And I still stare at you when you aren't looking. I still compose letters to you in my mind, pouring out my deepest emotions. I still craft playlists filled with songs that remind me of you. And I still plan a date in my head that would never come true.

I tried to tell you all these things in every little way possible, but I guess you failed to notice it. And now it hurts. It hurts everywhere. And I feel nothing and everything at the same time. And I just lie on my bed and look at the ceiling and tell myself, that it's okay. That one day I will still be lying on my bed and I will still be writing and everything will still be the same but it will hurt less and I will think less and the sadness will weigh less and I will finally be able to make peace with the reality and accept it and my heart will finally believe what eyes already see.
