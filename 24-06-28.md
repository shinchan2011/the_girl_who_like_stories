I hope you’re well. I know you may never read this, but sometimes, writing is the only solace I have left.

I still remember that time when we had our first conversation, a month after we joined college, when I told how I feel about you, probably coming off as strange or creepy. You must have thought I was out of my mind. But I was just overwhelmed by how much I liked you. It was like the world had stopped for a moment, and all I could see was you. You were quiet most of the time but still you seemed to light up every room you walked into—it was all so captivating. I never imagined that one day I’d be sitting here, pouring my heart out onto these pages, feeling this overwhelming sadness.

We were friends once, good friends. Those days feel like a lifetime ago now. We shared laughs, stories, and moments that I thought would last forever. But somewhere along the way, things changed. I fell for you, harder than I ever thought possible.

When I told you how I felt, it was both the scariest and the most liberating moment of my life. But you were with someone else, and I respected that. I tried to keep my distance, tried to suppress these feelings, but they only grew stronger. Each day, seeing you happy with him, tore me apart a little more. Yet, I couldn't bring myself to hate him, because he made you smile, and that’s all I ever wanted.

As much as it hurt, I valued our friendship too much to risk losing you. But eventually, even that slipped through my fingers. Asking you to block me was one of the hardest decisions I’ve ever made. I didn’t want to come between you and your happiness.

It’s been a month now, and not a day goes by when I don’t think about you. The saddest part is that you’re completely unaware of the effect you have on me, the sleepless nights, and the tears that I fight to hold back. I miss you—more than words can express.

I wish things were different. I wish I could go back to the days when we were just friends, when I could see you without this weight in my heart. But I know that’s impossible. I can’t undo what’s been said and done.

I hope you’re happy, truly. I hope he makes you feel as special as you are, and that your days are filled with love and joy. I’ll always carry a piece of you with me, in every beat of my heart and every breath I take. Maybe someday, this pain will fade, and I’ll be able to look back on our time together with a smile instead of tears.

Until then, I’ll keep writing, keep remembering, and keep hoping for a day when the memories of you bring more comfort than sorrow.
