Chapter 13: The Kingâ€™s Decision
The next day, Liam went to the palace, feeling a newfound confidence. He requested an audience with the king, and after much persuasion, he was allowed to speak to him.
Liam spoke from his heart, telling the king about his love for Sofia and how he would do anything to make her happy. The king listened carefully, seeing the sincerity and determination in Liamâ€™s eyes. He saw that Liamâ€™s love was true and pure, and though Liam was still just a simple boy, the king realized that love like this was rare.
The king, though conflicted, decided to test Liam. He decided to give him a difficult task, something only a person with great character could achieve.
