Chapter 10: The Struggle
Liam knew he had to do something quickly before it was too late. He decided that if he could build a good future for himself, maybe the king would allow him to marry the princess. Liam tried many things. He worked harder than ever, saved every penny, and even tried to learn new skills.
But no matter what he did, he couldnâ€™t seem to change his fate. He was still the same ordinary boy, and the more he tried, the more hopeless he felt. Days turned into weeks, and Liam began to lose hope.
