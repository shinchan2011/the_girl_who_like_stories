I've been thinking about what you said, you know to stay friends and I guess I can do that. I mean you once said that I am your only friend with whom you talk poetically so I guess I cant take that away from you. And you asking for friendship is reasonable, and not even listening to you would be a very mean and selfish thing to do.

I cant talk to you in person but we don't need that anyway I guess, because I believe we never really did so, right? I will send you songs on weekends like I used to. And I will tell you about my days if I ever feel low, or maybe I will send you some stories sometimes if you would like that or maybe I will tell anything stupid for no reason.
I hope this will make up for it.

Or if you also want to talk to me anytime about how your day went or anything thats in your mind then I guess I would love to hear itðŸ˜Š
