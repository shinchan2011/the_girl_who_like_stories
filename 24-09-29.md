Chapter 18: The Return
Liam’s journey back to the kingdom was just as difficult, but he was filled with hope. He had proven his worth and was eager to return to Sofia. When he finally arrived at the palace, exhausted but triumphant, he was greeted by the king himself.
The king was amazed that Liam had succeeded where so many others had failed. He took the flower and saw the determination and love in Liam’s eyes. The king knew then that Liam was no ordinary boy—he was a man of great courage and character, worthy of his daughter’s love.
