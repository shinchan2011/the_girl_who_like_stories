Hi!
I am lying on my bead right now, having a little headache, came back from Varanasi 2 hrs ago. Well if you ask me the past few days was really fun. Well, we left on 28 afternoon, and reached varanasi the morning after. We almost didnt sleep at all that day, took off for Kal bhairav Mandir directly after bath. Then from there we went Kashi Vishwanath Mandir, and waited for 5hrs straight in sunlight, after that we had breakfast or you can say brunch as it was 12noon then. After that we had few juice as it was really hot and then shopped a little and then after that we looked for auto but we didnt get any and had to walk all the way to gurudwara, oh by the way I forget to mention that we stated in Gurudwara, actually paji's father is the secretary of a Gurudwara there so we got VIP rooms. So we slept through the afternoon and went for the Ganga Arti of Dashashwamedh Ghat and it was really beautiful and i just that pretty much cover the our day one. The very first thing that we did the next day was breakfast at a roadside stall and their dosa is one of the best that I ever had. And the stall owner turned out to be a really friendly guy, he set us up with a E-Rickshaw that gave us atmost the whole tour of the city. First he took us to Sarnath, where we explored the Dhamekh Stupa and a fascinating museum. Then, off we went to Namo Ghat, we spent a little time there. Next stop was the Ramnagar Fort, followed by a visit to BHU where we checked out the Vishwanath temple. The day continued as we visited the Durga Kund Mandir and then made our way to Assi Ghat, where we had a boat ride from Assi Ghat to Manikarnika Ghat and with that our second day came to an end. On the Third day we booked a car and went to Vindhyachal, there we explored three mandirs Vindhyavasini Mandir, Kali khoh Mandir and Ashtabhuja mandir and after that we went for Chunar fort and after that Dev went home and we had our train at evening which got late by 12 hrs so we had to book a room near station. We boarded the train at sunrise and reached college at 4. So that was pretty much the zist of our trip, hope you didnt got bored. I wish if I could ever visit those places again with you.
