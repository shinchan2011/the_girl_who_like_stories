Hi!
Well, its 3:40 in the morning now. Pata nahi achanak se aankh khul gayi. Aur ab neend hi nahi aa rahi. I miss those days when I used to wake up and see if you have texted me back. I know that from getting to know someone, to loving them, its such a long journey. And I know you didnt have the emotional capacity to start the whole process again with someone. I guess when we're young, we just believe there'll be many people with whom we'll connect with. And later in life, we realize it only happens a few times. I think it happened to you. That you have met that people of you. And if I am right, if you really have then no matter what happen just dont let him go. I wish that it never happens that you both stop talking to each other. But somehow if it does happen then please remember that, when we loose touch with someone, we just try to store up all the things in our mind that we want to tell them from every big events to every small details and we think that the next time when we will meet I am gonna tell her/him everything, but it just never happen so, right. Because when we finally see each other we either just ignore them or just fake it saying that whatever happened, happened for good. And even if we gather the courage to tell them what we really want to, we just end up talking about big events thinking its too much bother to talk about the little things but its the little things that makes up life, right. I know people say that its never late for anything but trust me it doesnt always work like that. So if you ever loose touch with him and the next time when you meet him then please spill your heart out and tell him what you had been keeping inside you for so long and not because he will be unaware of those things, but because its the right thing to do. And tell him that its his memory that always make you happy whenever you think about it. But just remember whenever you tell him just tell him in person and not in chat. And if you missed anything that you wanted to say then save it for the next time and just spill that out no matter if the topic you are talking in is different cause you know you dont have to be perfect around him and he will understand you anyway.
