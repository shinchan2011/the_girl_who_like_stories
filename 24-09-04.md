Chapter 4: The Reason Behind Her Smile
What Liam didn’t know was that Sofia was no ordinary girl—she was the princess of the kingdom, visiting the village in disguise to escape the constraints of palace life. Unlike the courtiers and nobles who surrounded her daily, Liam’s gestures were different. He didn’t know she was a princess, and that made all the difference. Everyone else she knew did things for her because of her royal status, but Liam did them out of the kindness of his heart, simply because he liked her.
This touched Sofia deeply. She had always longed for someone who would see her for who she truly was, not for her title. Slowly, she found herself falling for Liam, charmed by his sincerity and the way he treated her as a person, not as a princess.
