terko mann nahi karta mujhse baat karne ka?
mai koshish karta tha ki tujhse jitna ho sake baatein karoon, har waqt koi na koi naya bahana dhunta rahta tha baatein shuru karke ke liye aur phir bhi kiti kamm baatein ho pati thi hamari
last year maine cookie or nugget ki story likhi thi, aur use jitna lamba khich sakta tha khicha, sirf issi liye ki mai roz tumhe ek slide bhejunga to kam se kam hamare pass hardin kuch to hoga baat karne ko
choro yaar mai bhi kyon hi bata raha tumhe ye sab.
ye batao ki kaise ho? sab thik to chal raha na? last year kuch zyada baar hi bimar padd gayi thi tu. I hope ki iss baar sab thik hai. abhi kuch din pehle to tu ghar se wapis aayi hai right? ghar me sab kaise hai? aur atru kaisi hai?
I hope ki sab thik hi honge.
I guess phir chalta hoon mai. phir baat karte hai kabhi.

chalo suna hi deta hoon

ek kaam karta hoon mai aaj pehla chapter bhej deta hoon. phir kal dusra. aur aage hardin ek ek karke. chalega na?
I mean ab mujhe bhi to bahana chahiye ek. tujjse rozz baatein karne ke liye.


Chapter 1: The Humble Shop Boy
In the heart of a quaint village, nestled between rolling hills and a sparkling river, there was a small shop owned by Mr. Thompson, a kind and elderly man. His most trusted helper was Liam, a humble and hardworking boy with a heart as pure as gold. Liam’s life was simple—he spent his days stacking shelves, helping customers, and keeping the shop tidy. Despite his modest means, Liam found joy in his work and the people he met every day.
