Hi!
Maaf karna 5 din ho gaye aur maine kuch likha hi nhi.
Well, actually, I was doing a lot of thinking these days and I was even a little confused about some stuff. But now I guess I am fine.
Btw I wrote you a poem. Do you wanna hear? Waise to I have written a lot of poems and other stuff but this one I wrote recently so isliye pooch liya ki agr tumhe sunna ho.
Chalo choro kya hi sunogi. Waise bhi itni acchi hai bhi nhi ki kisiko sunai jaye.
So tell me, how are you? I mean abhi to classes bhi nhi chal rhi to shayad kuch to alag ho rha hoga. sketching?? maybe dancing?? aur maybe playing guitar?? hmm? kuch nhi chal rha?ðŸ«¤ðŸ˜• Agar meri baat kri jaye to yaar kaafi boring sa lg rha. I mean kuch zyada hi. Subah late se uthta hoon. Fir poora din yuhi beet jaata hai. Kuch pata hi nhi chalta. Waise dekha jaye to hum rojj sirf meri hi baat rte hai. Agar tumhare pass kuch hai to sanao.
Chalo rehne do mai hi sunata hoon. Terko yaad hai? Pichle saal aaj ke hi din, pehli baar hum class mein saath baithe the. Actually 26th september ko. Agar sach kahoon to kaafi himmat lagi thi yaar uss din. uss din se pehle bhi najane kitni baar koshish ki thi maine. Aur jab finally tere paas aake baitha, toh itna nervous tha ki poora waqt meri left leg kaanp rahi thi. I mean, I was literally shaking the entire time! and even my heart was racing so fast. Merko to yaad bhi nhi ki najane kya kya kaha tha maine terko uss din. But I remember that you were in your pink thirt that day. Aur haan tumne ussi din kaha tha ki the watch you wear was given by your Dad when your were in 5th standard. Aur merko to ab bhi yakin nhi ho raha ki terko apne laptop ka model no. tak yaad hai. Terko nhi lgta that a year ago everything was so different, and now when I look back, I realize that a year can do a lot to someone's life.

I dont know I went to bed around 2:30 and suddenly woke up around 4. aur ab najane kyon neend hi nahi aa rhi to socha tumse thori baatein karlu and see its almost 5 now. Everyday, I stay awake till 2 but I dont really study during this time. I generally write or sketch. But mostly I wait, because a part of me wonders ki kya pata agar tum kabhi pareshan ya dukhi ho, halaki mai kabhi nhi chahunga ki aisa kuch bhi ho tumhare sath. But just in case, if you're lost in your thoughts, overthinking, or feeling upset and you couldnt sleep and you decide to reach out, then I want to be here. So I wait, so I don't miss it if you need me.
Looks like it's finally time for the story. Sorry to keep you waiting.

Chapter 16: The Enchanted Forest
As Liam neared the mountains, he entered a dense forest that seemed almost magical in its own way. The trees were tall and ancient, their branches forming a canopy that blocked out most of the sunlight. The air was filled with the sounds of rustling leaves and distant bird calls.
In the heart of the forest, Liam came across a wide river with strong currents, making it impossible to cross directly. Just as he was beginning to lose hope, he noticed a small wooden bridge partially hidden by overgrown vegetation. The bridge looked old and rickety, but it was his only option.
With careful steps, Liam began to cross the bridge. Halfway across, the wooden planks beneath him started to creak and splinter. Suddenly, the bridge gave way, and Liam fell into the river with a splash. The cold water shocked him, and the strong current began to pull him downstream.
Panicking for a moment, Liam spotted a large wooden log floating nearby. Gathering his strength, he swam towards it and managed to grab hold. Using the log as support, he floated down the river, guiding himself with the current until he reached the riverbank.
Exhausted but relieved, Liam climbed out of the water, dripping wet but undeterred. He knew that the journey ahead would be filled with challenges, but his determination to find the magical flower and prove his worth only grew stronger.

Accha haan last sunday maine song bhi nahi bheja tha, maaf krnaðŸ˜…
Today's Song - Line Without a Hook by Ricky Montgomery
Well, I noticed you had a song on your note today. Iâ€™ve heard CO2 before, but Iâ€™ll give it another listen. Was it meant for me, if you donâ€™t mind me asking? Actually, forget I asked. I shouldnâ€™t have brought it up. Youâ€™re probably just listening to it yourself and decided to put it on your note. I'm sorry I asked it.
