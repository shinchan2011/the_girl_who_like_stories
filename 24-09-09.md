Chapter 8: The Forbidden Love
One evening, after weeks of searching, Liam finally caught a glimpse of Sofia in the palace gardens. She was standing by a fountain, looking out over the water, her expression sombre. His heart ached to see her so sad. That night, he slipped a note under her door, pouring out his feelings and revealing that he knew her true identity.
The next day, Liam found a note waiting for him. It was from Sofia. She wrote about how much she missed him and how she had fallen for him because he was the only one who treated her as a person and not a princess. She explained that her father, the king, had forbidden her from seeing him, but she wished things could be different.
