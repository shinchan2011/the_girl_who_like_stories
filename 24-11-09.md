CHAPTER 14: THE GROWING BOND
As Aarav and Naina spent more time together, their connection deepened, and it was something Meera couldn’t ignore. She watched as Aarav began to change, becoming more open and expressive, especially when Naina was around. While Meera was glad to see him happier, a small part of her couldn’t help but worry.
Meera deep down couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. She knew Aarav had a habit of keeping his struggles to himself, even when things seemed to be getting better. The fear that he might end up hurt again stayed with her.
One day, as Meera was walking across campus, she spotted Aarav and Naina sitting together on a bench under a large oak tree. They were deep in conversation, with Naina leaning in, her eyes full of interest, while Aarav listened closely, more engaged than Meera had ever seen him. A pang of jealousy hit Meera, and she felt guilty for it. She knew her feelings were irrational, but she couldn’t help being protective of Aarav.
That evening, Meera found herself unable to focus on her studies. Her thoughts kept drifting back to Aarav and Naina. She decided to call Rohan, hoping that talking to him might help clear her mind.
"Hey, Rohan, can we talk?" she asked when he picked up the phone.
"Sure," Rohan replied. "What’s up?"
They met at their usual café, a cozy spot where they often talked. Meera arrived early and sipped her hot chocolate, trying to figure out how to express her worries.
When Rohan arrived, he smiled warmly and sat down across from her. "So, what’s on your mind?"
Meera took a deep breath. "It’s about Aarav and Naina. They’ve gotten really close, and while I’m happy for Aarav, I can’t help but worry. He’s been through so much, and I’m scared he might end up getting hurt again."
Rohan listened carefully, his face serious. "I get it, Meera. Aarav’s been through a lot, and it’s normal to be concerned. But Naina seems to genuinely care about him. She’s been patient and supportive, which is what he needs right now."
Meera nodded, but her worry didn’t go away. "I know, and I’m thankful that Naina is there for him. But what if things don’t work out? What if she ends up hurting him, even if she doesn’t mean to?"
Rohan reached across the table and took her hand. "We can’t predict what will happen, Meera. All we can do is be there for Aarav and trust that he’s making the right choices. So far, it looks like Naina is helping him, and that’s a good thing."
Meera appreciated Rohan’s perspective but still felt uneasy. She knew her feelings were partly driven by her own fears of losing Aarav as a close friend. She hoped that with time, she would come to accept the changes and find peace with the new dynamics in their group.
Meanwhile, Meera and Rohan continued to support Aarav in their own ways. Rohan remained upbeat and encouraging, always ready to lift everyone’s spirits. Meera, on the other hand, struggled with her own feelings of being left out. She tried to be supportive, but it was hard to adjust to the changes within their group.
One evening, after the group had dinner at their favourite restaurant, Meera watched Aarav and Naina with mixed emotions. Naina’s easy-going nature seemed to bring out a side of Aarav that Meera rarely saw—he was more relaxed and open. While Meera was glad to see Aarav happier, she couldn’t shake the worry that their growing closeness might lead to complications.
As they left the restaurant, Meera found herself alone with Naina for a moment. She decided to address her concerns directly.
"Naina," Meera said, choosing her words carefully, "I've noticed Aarav seems a bit more relaxed lately, especially when you’re around. It's nice to see."
Naina glanced at Meera, her smile sincere. "I’m glad to hear that. He’s a good guy, and I just want to make sure he feels supported."
Meera hesitated for a moment before continuing, "He is, and that's why I wanted to talk to you. Aarav has been through some tough situations, and I just want to make sure he doesn’t get hurt again. He’s the kind of person who feels things deeply, even if he doesn’t always show it."
Naina’s expression grew serious, her voice filled with reassurance. "I completely understand, Meera. I care about him too, and I’ll do everything I can to be careful with his feelings."
Meera’s expression softened as she continued, "You know, when Aarav first joined our group, he was so closed off. It’s taken a lot of time and patience to get him to this point, where he feels safe enough to share more of himself. I don’t want anything to jeopardize that progress."
Naina’s eyes reflected her understanding as she replied, "I get that, Meera. I’ve seen glimpses of that vulnerability in him, and it’s made me realize how important it is to tread carefully. But I also believe that being open with each other is what will help him the most. He needs to know that we’re here for him, no matter what."
Meera felt a bit more at ease after hearing Naina’s reassurance. She hoped that with Naina’s care and patience, Aarav would continue to heal and find happiness..
And so, as the days passed and the seasons changed, each of them continued to grow and change in their own ways. The unspoken feelings and hidden emotions were still there, but they were part of the journey, a reminder of how deep their connections ran and how strong their bond truly was.
