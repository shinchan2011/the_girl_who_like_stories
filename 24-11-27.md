CHAPTER 22: ADJUSTING TO CHANGES
As Aarav and Naina continued to explore their feelings, they chose not to define their relationship. By not labelling it, they enjoyed their time together without the pressure of fitting into any category. This approach allowed them to be themselves and grow closer without expectations weighing them down.
Rohan and Meera noticed the change in Aarav right away. He seemed happier, laughed more easily, and was more open to activities he had previously avoided. Nainaâ€™s influence was clear, and while Rohan was pleased to see his friend in a better place, Meera still felt increasingly uneasy.
One afternoon, the group was relaxing in the park after a casual picnic. Naina and Aarav were engaged in a lively discussion about their favourite books. Their shared smiles and jokes signalled a shift in the group dynamic that Meera couldnâ€™t ignore.
Feeling uncomfortable, Meera decided it was time to address her concerns. She stood up and walked over to Aarav with a determined look. "Aarav, can we talk for a minute?" she asked, her tone firm but gentle.
Aarav glanced at Naina, who gave him a reassuring nod, before he followed Meera to a quieter spot under a big oak tree. Despite the park being busy, this area felt private.
"What's up, Meera?" Aarav asked, trying to sound casual but sensing the tension.
Meera took a deep breath. "I know we have talked about this before but Iâ€™ve noticed that things between you and Naina have... changed. I just want to make sure youâ€™re okay."
Aarav was surprised by her directness. "Iâ€™m okay, Meera. I promise."
Meera looked at him intently. "Are you sure? Because it feels like weâ€™re drifting apart. Like thereâ€™s this... distance."
Aarav felt a pang of guilt. He hadnâ€™t meant to push Meera away, but he realized his focus on Naina might have unintentionally created a gap.
"Meera, Iâ€™m sorry if it feels that way," Aarav said sincerely. "Iâ€™ve been trying to figure things out with Naina."
Meeraâ€™s expression softened. "I just donâ€™t want to lose you, Aarav. Youâ€™ve always been there for me, and I want to be there for you too."
"Youâ€™re not going to lose me," Aarav assured her, gently squeezing her hand. "Our friendship means a lot to me. I just need you to trust me while I figure things out with Naina."
Meera nodded, a small smile appearing. "I trust you, Aarav. Just donâ€™t shut me out, okay?"
"I wonâ€™t," Aarav promised. "Iâ€™m sorry if Iâ€™ve seemed distant. Iâ€™m just trying to navigate this new chapter."
As they walked back to Rohan and Naina, Meeraâ€™s smile was more genuine. She understood that change was part of life and that Aaravâ€™s happiness was important. While she still had reservations, she was willing to support him.
Back with the group, Rohan was animatedly discussing a new movie release. He looked up and grinned as Meera and Aarav rejoined them. "So, did you two sort things out?"
Meera nodded, her tone light. "Yes, we did. Everythingâ€™s good."
Naina looked between them, her eyes warm. "Iâ€™m glad you two could talk. Communication is important."
Rohan gave Naina a thumbs-up. "Agreed. And letâ€™s not forget about the movie marathon we were planning. Iâ€™ve got some great films lined up."
As they settled back into their group, the earlier tension seemed to melt away. Conversations flowed easily, laughter filled the air, and Aarav felt a renewed sense of connection with his friends.
Later, as the sun set and the park quieted down, Naina and Aarav walked side by side.
"You know," Naina said thoughtfully, "I think weâ€™re finding a good balance. Itâ€™s nice to see everyone getting along and moving forward together."
Aarav nodded, a smile on his face. "I agree. Itâ€™s been a whirlwind, but Iâ€™m glad weâ€™re figuring it out together. Thanks for being so understanding."
Naina squeezed his hand gently. "Itâ€™s easy when you have someone like you by my side. Weâ€™ll keep figuring things out, step by step."
