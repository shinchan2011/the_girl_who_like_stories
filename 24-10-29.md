Sahi baat hai. Alge mahine to jaa hi rahe, aur waise bhi itna pass to ghar hai nhi ki jab mann chaha chale jaye. right?
Kaafi boring-boring sa lagg raha yaar. Classes ho nahi rahi, aur kuch krne ka mann bhi kr nhi raha🫤. Dekha jaye to normally bhi apna zyada khas kuch krte hai nhi. But abhi when I know ki baaki sab ghar chale gaye aur mai yahi hoon, sochkar thora ajeeb to lgg raha.
Last year to diwali par Dev aur Somesh bhi the, is baar to vo dono bhi ghar jaa rahe🥲. sedd😕. Waise tumhare kya plans hai Diwali ke iss bar?
Apan ka to kuch khaas nhi. Waise bhi college mai to puja ho hi rahi to sirf apan ne lunch ka plan banaya hai. Abhi tak. You know what, Krati bhi chal rahi aur Aastha bhi, maybe you should also join us, if you want to. Agar tumahre koi dusre plans hai uss din to koi baat nhi. But if not then you could come with us, mazza aayega.🙂

CHAPTER 9: THE UNFOLDING ROMANCE
As the trip neared its end, the atmosphere changed. Meera and Rohan’s relationship had grown deeper. Their affection was clear—how they looked at each other, held hands, and shared glances full of unspoken love. Their bond was getting stronger each day, blossoming in the peaceful setting of the hills.
For Aarav, however, the trip had not brought the clarity he had hoped for. Instead, it made him feel more like an outsider. Despite being close to them physically, he felt increasingly isolated from the joy and intimacy between Meera and Rohan. It highlighted how alone he felt in this new dynamic.
One evening, as the sun set and painted the sky with a golden glow, the group began packing up their things. The air was filled with mixed feelings—eager to return home but sad to leave behind the calm of the hills.
Meera noticed Aarav working quietly on his own, his sadness apparent. She walked over to him, trying to bridge the emotional gap between them. “I’m really glad we went on this trip,” she said softly. “It’s been good for us.”
Aarav looked up from his packing, his face showing gratitude and sadness. “Yeah, it’s been nice,” he replied, his voice betraying his struggle to stay positive.
Meera took a deep breath, choosing her words carefully. “I want you to know I’m here for you. I know things have been a bit strange lately, but I still value our friendship a lot.”
Her words were a small comfort to Aarav. He looked at her and felt a pang of gratitude. “Thanks, Meera. I value our friendship too.”
Though it wasn’t the resolution Aarav had hoped for, it was something. The acknowledgment of their bond offered a small relief to his heart. It was a reminder that, despite the complexity of his feelings, their friendship was still strong.
As they continued packing, Rohan joined them, his mood cheerful as he talked about their next adventure. He had noticed the brief, heartfelt exchange between Meera and Aarav and hoped that Aarav would find the clarity he needed in time.
The drive back to the city was filled with both reflection and anticipation. Meera and Rohan sat close, their conversation easy and their touches frequent. Aarav, seated in the back, looked out the window, feeling heavy-hearted. The trip had been a beautiful escape but also highlighted the reality he faced a reality that was both painful and eye-opening.
As they reached the city, Meera turned to Aarav, a mix of hope and concern on her face. “We should catch up soon, just the three of us,” she suggested. “Maybe a movie night or dinner.”
Aarav nodded, appreciating the thought. “That sounds good,” he said with a small smile. “I’d like that.”
The promise of future get-togethers was a small but meaningful step towards mending their friendship. For Aarav, it was a sign that, while the journey was far from over, there was still room for healing and understanding.
As they parted ways, Aarav felt both relief and apprehension. The trip had been emotional, but it had also offered moments of clarity. He was still working through his feelings, but he knew that the support of his friends, even if not in the way he had hoped, was important for this new chapter of his life.
