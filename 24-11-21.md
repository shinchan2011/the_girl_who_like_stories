CHAPTER 20: THE CONFESSION
As the weeks went by, Naina noticed a big change in Aarav. He seemed lighter, happier, and more himself than he had been in a long time. Naina felt proud to have helped him reach this point. Yet, there was also a new tension between them, a silent understanding that something more might be growing.
However, Naina couldn't ignore the impatience that was beginning to gnaw at her. It had been more than half a year, and while Aarav had undeniably developed feelings for her, his emotions for Meera remained almost as strong as ever. Naina understood that Aarav needed time to sort through his complicated feelings, but the waiting was becoming harder to bear. She found herself increasingly restless, knowing that their connection was deepening but still overshadowed by his lingering attachment to Meera.
Naina was certain that Aarav knew how she felt about him, yet there was an unspoken barrier between them. She realized that she couldn’t wait much longer. It was time to confess her feelings openly, to make it clear where she stood and what she wanted for their future—because if they were going to move forward, everything needed to be out in the open.
One evening, after a day of exploring the city and taking photos, Aarav and Naina found themselves by the river. The soft city sounds behind them and the calm river created a peaceful setting for their talk.
Naina turned to Aarav, her face serious—a rare look for her usually playful self. "Aarav, can I ask you something?"
Aarav sensed the seriousness in her tone and nodded. "Of course. What’s on your mind?"
Naina took a deep breath, choosing her words carefully. "Do you ever think about… what might happen if things were different? If you weren’t in love with Meera?"
Aarav’s heart raced at her directness. The question struck him deeply. He had been struggling with his feelings, but this was the first time someone had addressed them so openly.
"I… I don’t know," Aarav said quietly. "It’s complicated. My feelings for Meera are still there, and it’s not easy to just turn them off."
Naina nodded, her eyes steady. "I get that it’s complicated. But Aarav, I care about you. More than just a friend. I needed you to know that."
Her words hit Aarav hard. He had felt the shift in their relationship, but hearing it out loud made it more real. He was torn between the comfort of Naina’s presence and the unresolved feelings he still had for Meera.
"I… I appreciate your honesty," Aarav said, struggling with his emotions. "But I’m not sure how to handle this. I don’t want to hurt you, especially after everything you’ve done for me."
Naina reached out and placed a comforting hand on his. "I’m not asking for anything right now. I just wanted you to know how I feel. Whatever happens, I’m here for you."
Aarav looked at her, feeling both thankful and confused. He wasn’t ready to deal with his feelings just yet, but he knew he couldn’t ignore them forever. "Thank you, Naina. I need some time to figure things out."
Naina’s smile was gentle, understanding the weight of his words. "Take all the time you need. I’ll be here, no matter what."
They sat together in silence, the quiet sound of the river calming their turbulent emotions. Aarav felt comforted by Naina’s presence, but he was also filled with uncertainty. He knew that whatever came next would bring significant changes.
After a moment, Naina spoke again, her voice soft but firm. "Aarav, whatever happens, I want you to know that I’m grateful for the time we’ve spent together. You’ve helped me see things differently, and I hope I’ve done the same for you."
Aarav nodded, feeling a mix of emotions. "You have, Naina. You’ve shown me a new perspective. I just wish I could give you a clearer answer right now."
Naina squeezed his hand gently. "It’s okay. Clarity takes time. We’re both on a journey, and sometimes it’s not clear. What matters is that we’re honest with ourselves and with each other."
Aarav smiled, feeling relieved. "I’m glad we can talk about this openly. It means a lot to me."
As they sat by the river, the weight of their conversation hung between them. Aarav and Naina both knew their relationship was at a turning point, but they were committed to facing whatever came next with honesty and respect.
