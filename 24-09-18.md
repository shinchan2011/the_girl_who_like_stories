Chapter 14: The Kingâ€™s Test
The king listened carefully to Liamâ€™s words and saw the honesty in his eyes. He realized that Liamâ€™s love for Sofia was genuine, but he couldnâ€™t simply allow his daughter to marry a commoner. The king decided to give Liam a task to prove his worth. A task that would test his bravery, wisdom, and character.
The king instructed Liam to retrieve a rare and magical flower that grew on the highest peak of the Snowy Mountains, far beyond the kingdomâ€™s borders. The flower was said to bloom only once a year, and its petals had the power to heal any wound or illness. Many had tried to find the flower, but none had returned. The king knew that if Liam succeeded, he would prove that he was worthy of the princessâ€™s love
The king, though conflicted, decided to test Liam. He decided to give him a difficult task, something only a person with great character could achieve.

Accha suno, tum aaj kuch kehna chahti thi kya?
I mean tum generally rukti nahi class ke baad, but today you did, to mujhe laga ki shayad tumhe kuch kehna ho.
Aur ye sab jaante hue bhi mai uthke chala gayaðŸ¥². Kitna bura hoon na main. Khair, buri to poori duniya hi hai, to mere bhi bure ho jane se kya hi fark padta hai. Accha isse yaad aaya ki tum shayad uss din kuch aur bhi kehna chahti thi, I am talking about 10th June.
Uss din shayad thora gusse me thi tum, najane kyon achanak se tumhare do bde bde messeges aa gaye the. Lekin mujhe pata hai ki whatever you said that day, I donâ€™t think you meant all of it. Because I believe we dont treat people based on what we think about them but rather we treat them on what state of mind we are in. right? I guess tere mann me bhi bahut kuch chal raha tha uss din, par isse pehle ki tum kuch kehti, maine hi tumhe keh diya ki you should block me. Waise meri hi galti hai, mujhe sunn leni chahiye thi tumhari poori baat.
Chalo choro ye baatein, kaya pata aisa kuch ho hi na. Ki tumhe aaj kuch kehna hi na ho aur tum bas yuhi class ke baad bethi ho, aur mai faltu me hi ye sab kahaniyan bana raha hoon. Waise ye sab normal hai mere liye, mai yoon ulti-seedhi chizen sochta rehta har samay.
