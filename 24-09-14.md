hey!
saw you today, Aastha ke sath, I didn't expect you to come

so I believe you cracked it. I am talking about the code
how long have you been reading it?
mai to sirf yu hi likh rah tha. mujhe nahi pata tha ki ek din tu isse padh bhi rahi hogi

najane kyon ab thora alag sa lag raha yaar. isse pehle mujhe lgta tha ki sirf mai hi isse padh rah to mai bindas kuch bhi likh deta tha
abb jab mujhe pata hai ki you are reading it on the other side to pata nahi mai itna soch kyon raha likhne se pehle.
but don't worry I will be honest. I know you are reading it only because its raw and you value the honesty.
lekin haan mai vo date count nahi likh rah ab se. thora ajeeb sa lag raha likhna ab.
chalo choro ye sab. I believe you must be waiting for the next part of your story. right?

Chapter 12: The Wish
Liam couldn’t believe what he was hearing. An angel? A wish? It sounded too good to be true. But he had nothing to lose, so he thought carefully about what he wanted. Liam knew he didn’t want riches or power. He just wanted to be worthy of Princess Sofia’s love.
“I wish to be someone who can make Sofia happy, someone who can stand by her side without shame,” Liam said.
The angel nodded and granted his wish. In a flash, Liam felt a warmth spread through him. He didn’t feel different on the outside, but something inside him had changed. The angel told him that his true worth would be seen by those who looked with their hearts, not their eyes.

aur ek aur chiz. the bus you gave me was really cute. I will keep it safe
