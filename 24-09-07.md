Chapter 6: The Royal Secret
One day, while delivering goods to a wealthy merchant’s home, Liam overheard a conversation that made his heart stop. The merchant’s wife was talking about how the king had discovered that Princess Sofia had been sneaking out of the palace in disguise, mingling with commoners. The king, concerned for her safety and reputation, had ordered her to remain within the palace walls.
Liam realized, with a mix of shock and sadness, that Sofia—the girl he had fallen in love with—was actually the princess. His mind raced with thoughts of how different their lives were. He was just a shop boy, and she was royalty. How could he ever hope to be with her?
