Chapter 19: The Royal Decision
The king called for Sofia and told her of Liam’s success. Sofia’s eyes filled with tears of joy when she saw Liam standing before her, holding the magical flower. The king, moved by the love between them, decided to grant Liam his wish. He gave his blessing for Liam and Sofia to be together, but there was one final condition.
The king announced that Liam would be given a title and a small piece of land within the kingdom. He would have the chance to prove himself as a leader and a nobleman. If he succeeded, he would be allowed to marry Sofia and live as a prince by her side.
