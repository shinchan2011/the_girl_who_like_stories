Hey, I just realized yesterday was 12th December. I don’t know if you remember, but it was Enyugma two years ago, Star Night, to be specific. By the way, I never asked you, how was your Enyugma? It must have been great, I believe. Mine was too. You remember we first met on Star Night? Dev introduce ed me to you. Actually, I had asked him to. You were standing with someone else at that time. I think it was Riyansh sir, though I’m not entirely sure. Honestly, if I had known that you liked him, I wouldn’t have asked Dev to introduce me. You thought I was in CSE, and I was surprised that you hadn’t noticed me in class. There were 96 people in the class, and it wasn’t even a month since classes began, so I guess it was okay. I do wonder how you and Riyansh sir met, though. These days, I’ve been trying to text you on Instagram. But I hesitate because I don’t know if I’m the only one who wants to talk. I wonder if I’m just pushing the conversation, and maybe you reply only out of politeness. So I end up not texting at all. I guess you don’t text me first because I asked you to block me on WhatsApp, and maybe you are afraid that you are disturbing me. Or maybe you don’t text me because you’re in a committed relationship now, and it doesn’t feel right to you. I guess we’re both right in our own ways. How are your holidays going? Studying all the time, I believe. Well, I’m not. I try to, but I just can’t study whole day long. You know, I don’t think we’re good friends. And honestly, I don’t think we ever will be. Texting alone doesn’t make a friendship healthy. This thought has been on my mind for over a year now. That’s why I tried to talk to you in person. I thought sitting beside you and having face to face conversations would help. But maybe the timing was wrong or maybe I was wrong. Honestly, I was looking for more than friendship, and I think that’s where everything went wrong. But I don’t think I was completely wrong either. I mean, I was thinking about you more than usual, and I just wanted to talk to you all the time. When you texted me last year returning from home after summer break, i was thinking the whole night about whether I should’ve offered to come pick you up from the station. And when you got typhoid, I felt so ashamed that I texted you all the time but didn’t help you when you really needed it. I even asked Vaibhav about you often when he used to take you for injections. I never asked directly but always tried to slip it into the conversation. I think that’s when he caught on that I liked you. Now that I think about it, I think you did the right thing. Cause honestly, I don’t deserve you. I started writing in the 4th semester. I was really missing talking to you but didn’t know how to start again. So, like always, I chose the easier way. I wrote it down in my journal. It felt like I was talking to you and it gave me a little relief. I even created a separate GitHub account, hosted a repo, and put a jumbled link to it in my bio. I kept it there because I thought you’d never decode it. Later, after you blocked me, I put the unjumbled link there, thinking it wouldn’t be visible to you anyway. I don't feel good now that you had to read all those things. I really miss talking to you.
