Chapter 7: A Plan to See Her Again
Despite the daunting truth, Liamâ€™s love for Sofia only grew stronger. He couldnâ€™t just forget about her. He decided that the only way to see her again was to find a way into the palace. Liam applied for a job as a servant at the palace, and after weeks of waiting, he was finally hired.
Working in the palace was much harder than he expected. The rules were strict, and the servants were constantly under supervision. But Liam didnâ€™t careâ€”every moment in the palace was a chance to be close to Sofia. However, the palace was vast, and finding her was no easy task.
