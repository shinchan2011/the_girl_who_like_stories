Hi!
Eid Mubarak. Well kaafi din ho gaye maine tumhe ek bhi kahani nahi sunai, right. Chalo phir ek sunata hoon aaj.

Well its a story of a girl. The story starts, the girl just woke up.
She looked at her phone and it was 9.30 in the morning. She had her breakfast, then she was lying on her bed, she didn't had school that day. And then she went out, she had her camera with her, she was obsessed with taking photos, so she went to a nearby river and took few photos, and then she head back. She didn't wanna go home that soon, as she had pretty much nothing to do. While on her way back she stopped by a movie theater and she went to the counter and found out that she is a little short on cash so she took the ticket of the cheapest movie available. She went inside and it was totally empty and there was only one boy at the other corner of the hall. After few minutes the movie started and it turned out to be a french movie with no subtitles
THE GIRL - (in loud voice, she called for anyone working in the theater)Hello!, where are the subtitles ?
(No one responded, but she got the attention of the boy, and after that he stood up and walked straight to her and sat next to her.)

THE BOY - You watch, I'll translate.
(She looked at her suspeciously, he looked at her back.)
THE GIRL - I think I'm just gonna go tell the theater owner.
THE BOY - Ya well you could, but I don't think it will do any good, cause I've seen it before and there's no subtitle.
THE GIRL - I can get my money back.
THE BOY - But its a really good movie, I don't think you want to miss it.
THE GIRL - Does it have a happy ending?
THE BOY - No, definitely not.
THE GIRL - Okay...
(And then he started translating)

(The movie was almost three hours long and it had a sad ending so the girl got tears, and after the movie was over she found out that she is holding the boy's hand)
THE GIRL - I'm sorry. How long was I doing that?
THE BOY - I don't know but maybe for an hour I guess.
THE GIRL - Why didn't you say something ?
THE BOY - The movie is a bit of a downer, so..
THE GIRL - Its a love story..
THE BOY - I mean, not all love stories are downers
THE GIRL - All the good ones are, Romeo and Juliet, La La Land, The English Patient. I think its the ending of a relationship, that makes a love story so memorable.
THE BOY - What about Pride and Prejudice? Jane Eyre? Those both have happy endings.
THE GIRL - Thats only because the writer chose to end thier love stories prematurely.
THE BOY - Wow, that is a really interesting way of not admitting you're wrong.
(The Girl started laughing)
THE GIRL - Okay, picture this. Picture that Leonardo Dicaprio didnt die at the end of Titanic
THE BOY - Do I have to?
THE GIRL - Yes, you have to.
THE GIRL - Jack Dawson is a jobless, penniless gambler, who possessed, at best, marginal artistic talent.
THE BOY - He saved Rose's life
THE GIRL - Right, of course, But he also love-bombed her and stole her away from her fiance, who obviously was an asshole who did't deserve her. And poor Rose was just so hypnotized by that steamy car sex, that she thought that he'd give her a life of passionate adventure? I mean come on. That's a life of poverty and ...
THE BOY - My god you have really given your thoughts on that, huhh
THE GIRL - Oh I did.

(A man who works on that theatre comes in and says)
The Man - Okay, the movie is over...
THE BOY - Yaa well okay.
THE GIRL - So, how did you get so good at speaking French?
THE BOY - My dad is a foreign language professor. So he had me fluent in French, Spanish and Italian by the time I was 12.
THE GIRL - Woww, thats impressive..
THE BOY - Yaa, I get that a lot..
THE GIRL - Really ?
THE BOY - No, actually I have never gotten that before.


(they came out of the theater)
THE BOY - Well, I should probably..
THE GIRL - Yea, I too have to go.
THE BOY - umm, thank you for letting me whisper in your ear for three hours
THE GIRL - You are welcome.
THE BOY - Bye..
THE GIRL - Bye
THE BOY - Jeremy
THE GIRL - what?
THE BOY - My name. Its Jeremy
THE GIRL - I'm Melissa
THE BOY - Maybe I'll see you here again sometime
THE GIRL - Yeah. I would like that.


(And then they shook hand and he left)
(She regret that she didn't asked for his number)

(But after that day whenever she had time she used to go to that cinema to wait for him, but he never showed up )

(Then one day she went to an event with her friends, it was rowing actually and one of her friends was participating in it too and as she was taking their photos she saw that a boy came in her frame, well he was in tha background and it was all blurry, so she changed the lenses and looked again and yes, it was him)
(Well at the end her friends loose the race but the team they lose to was Jeremy's)


(She went to talk to him, (He was lying on the ground, as he was too tired after the race)
MELISSA - Congartulations,
JEREMY - Melissa, hey.. oh (he stood up and stumble over her)
MELISSA - woah.. woo.
JEREMY - Oh my god! I am sorry. My legs are always jell-o after races. But Hi, what are you doing here ?
MELISSA - I didn't knew that you were a ....
JEREMY - a jock ?
MELISSA - a jock yaa, jocks don't speak spanish, french and italian.
JEREMY - Well, this one does.
(and while this Jeremy's mother comes up)
MUM - Now that is what I call a finish.
JEREMY - Mum this is..
MUM - The....... movie theater girl
JEREMY - Her name is Melissa
MELISSA - How do you..
MUM - The blue eyes, Jeremy went on and on about them since..
JEREMY - Okay, mom thats enough..
MUM - You know, he spent weeks searching for you on the internet
JEREMY - mom...
MUM - Okay, It doesnt look like he wants me here so, Bye, it was nice meeting you, Melissa.
JEREMY - Yaa i guess that would be best. Byee momm

MELISSA - movie theater girl. huhh? thats a nice name.
JEREMY - Oo my mom, she was just. dont listen to her.
MELISSA - So you searched me on internet ?
JEREMY - Aa.........ummmm......
MELISSA - I regret we didnt exchanged number that day?
JEREMY - yaa, well that was a big mistake.


Well the rest of the story, I will save it for future. You know if maybe by any chance we ever talk, which I dont see happening but...............lets see
