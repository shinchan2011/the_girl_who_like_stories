CHAPTER 4: THE PUSH AND PULL
Back at the guesthouse, Rohan and Meera sat on the porch, enjoying the cool evening breeze. The sun had set, leaving a sky full of stars. Rohan was animatedly sharing one of his many funny stories, and Meera’s laughter filled the quiet night. There was a natural ease between them—Rohan’s lively energy matched perfectly with Meera’s quieter, thoughtful nature.
Despite their comfortable interaction, Meera couldn’t shake a growing unease. Aarav had been distant lately, and it felt different this time. She missed their easy conversations and the silent understanding they had always shared.
As Rohan continued his story, Meera’s thoughts drifted back to Aarav. She remembered how he had seemed withdrawn during their hike and the way he had looked away by the waterfall. She couldn’t help but feel worried.
Rohan noticed her distraction and gently squeezed her hand. “What’s on your mind?” he asked softly.
Meera gave a small smile and squeezed his hand back. “I’ve been thinking about Aarav. He’s been really quiet lately.”
Rohan’s expression turned thoughtful. He understood how important Aarav was to Meera. “Maybe he’s just enjoying some quiet time,” Rohan suggested. “You know he likes his alone time.”
“Yeah, maybe,” Meera said, though her voice carried uncertainty. “But it feels different this time. I hope he’s okay.”
Rohan put his arm around her, pulling her close. “He’s probably fine, Meera. He just needs a bit of space. You know how he is.”
Meera leaned her head on Rohan’s shoulder, comforted by his presence but still worried. Aarav was more than a friend to her; he was someone she deeply cared about. His withdrawal made her anxious, and she felt like there was something he wasn’t sharing.
Rohan continued with his stories, trying to distract Meera from her worries. Even as he spoke, Meera’s mind kept returning to Aarav. She remembered the quiet times they had shared, moments when their silence had meant a lot. Aarav had always been there for her, and she wanted to be there for him too. She just wasn’t sure how to reach out.
After a while, Rohan noticed Meera’s continued preoccupation. “You know,” he said, “if you’re worried about Aarav, maybe you should talk to him. He might open up if you ask.”
Meera considered this. She didn’t want to let their friendship slip away. Confronting him was intimidating, but Rohan’s advice made her realize she needed to address her concerns.
“You’re right,” Meera said, her resolve growing. “I should talk to him. I just don’t want to push him if he’s not ready.”
Rohan nodded, understanding her hesitation. “Just approach him gently. Let him know you’re there for him and that you’re ready to listen.”
Meera smiled at Rohan, grateful for his support. “Thanks, Rohan. I’ll find a way to talk to him. I hope he’ll be open with me.”
Rohan smiled back and gave her a soft kiss on the forehead. “He will be. He trusts you.”
As the night grew darker, Rohan and Meera continued their conversation, shifting to lighter topics. Even so, Meera’s thoughts were still on Aarav. She resolved to reconnect with him and offer her support.
Later, as Meera prepared for bed, her mind was full of thoughts about Aarav. She knew she needed to reach out soon and offer him the help he might need. Balancing her love for Rohan and her concern for Aarav was challenging, but she was determined to handle it with care.
As she drifted off to sleep, Meera hoped she could bridge the gap that had formed with Aarav and preserve their important friendship.
