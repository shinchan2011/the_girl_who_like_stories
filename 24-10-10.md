Chapter 22: A Happily Ever After
Liam and Sofia lived a life filled with love, laughter, and adventure. They ruled the kingdom with fairness and compassion, always remembering the journey that brought them together. The story of the shop boy and the princess became a legend, told to children for generations to comeâ€”a story of true love, courage, and the power of kindness.

Well, this is the last chapter of this story. I hope you have enjoyed it.
