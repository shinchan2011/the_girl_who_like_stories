Chapter 2: The Mysterious Girl
One day, a girl in a plain dress and a gentle smile walked into the shop. She was unlike anyone Liam had ever seen—graceful and kind, with a warmth that made everyone around her feel at ease. She introduced herself as Sofia, and from that day on, she visited the shop every afternoon, buying small items and chatting with Liam. Her visits became the highlight of Liam’s day, and soon, he found himself looking forward to seeing her more than anything else.
