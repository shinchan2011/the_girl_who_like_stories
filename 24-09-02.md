Chapter 3: A Growing Affection
As the days passed, Liam couldn’t help but notice that his feelings for Sofia were growing stronger. He had never felt this way before, but he was just a simple shop boy, and she seemed so far out of his reach. Still, Liam decided to show her how much she meant to him, even if he couldn’t find the right words.
Liam began doing small, thoughtful things for Sofia. He would save the freshest fruits for her, offer her flowers he picked on his way to the shop, and even learned to play a few tunes on the flute because she once mentioned how much she loved music. Each time, Sofia would smile, her eyes lighting up with a joy that made Liam’s heart race.
