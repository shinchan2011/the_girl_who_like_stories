Chapter 11: The Magical Encounter
One evening, as Liam sat outside the shop where he used to work, he saw an old man struggling to carry a heavy bag. Without thinking, Liam rushed to help him. The old man thanked him and asked why Liam looked so sad.
Liam told the old man everything—about Sofia, the princess, and how he was trying to win the king’s approval but kept failing. The old man listened carefully and then smiled. He told Liam that he was an angel in disguise and that because Liam had helped him, he would grant him one wish.

Ek aur chiz kehni thi
Tell your mom I wished her happy birthday
