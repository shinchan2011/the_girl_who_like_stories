Chapter 17: The Final Climb
Liam finally reached the base of the Snowy Mountains. The peak was high above, shrouded in clouds and snow. The climb was gruelling, and the cold winds cut through him like a knife. Liam’s hands were numb, and his feet ached, but he kept going. He knew that Sofia was waiting for him, and that thought kept him warm.
After days of climbing, Liam finally reached the summit. There, on a small patch of snow-covered ground, he saw the magical flower. It was more beautiful than anything he had ever seen, with petals that shimmered in the light. Liam carefully picked the flower, knowing that he had completed the king’s task.
