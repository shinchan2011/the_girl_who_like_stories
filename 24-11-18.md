CHAPTER 18: A STEP TOWARD HEALING
The next day, Aarav took Naina’s advice seriously. He found his old camera, which had been gathering dust for years, and decided to dive back into his forgotten passion for photography. It used to be his way to capture and understand the world, a way to express himself when words weren’t enough. But his feelings for Meera and the struggle to deal with them had made him lose interest.
Aarav wandered through the city with his camera, taking pictures of everything that caught his eye. He photographed everything from the light streaming through the trees to the everyday moments of people walking by. Each click of the shutter helped him focus his thoughts and feel more connected to himself.
Naina joined him on these outings, and her excitement was contagious. One afternoon, they explored a park by the river where sunlight danced on the water and the sounds of nature filled the air.
“You’ve got a great eye for this,” Naina said, peeking over Aarav’s shoulder as he adjusted his camera. “This shot of the bridge with the light through the trees is beautiful.”
Aarav smiled, feeling grateful for her praise. “Thanks, Naina. I’ve missed this. It feels like I’m reconnecting with myself.”
Naina nodded, her eyes thoughtful. “It’s not just about the pictures. It’s about how you see the world and the feelings you’re capturing.”
Aarav focused on a young couple sitting on a bench, their moment of quiet together. “It’s a way for me to express feelings I haven’t been able to put into words. I used to find comfort in photography, but I let it go.”
Naina watched him with admiration. “I’m glad you’re getting back into it. It’s like you’re finding a part of yourself that was lost.”
They continued their walk, with Naina offering her observations. “You see beauty in the everyday things, and that’s a special skill.”
Aarav looked at her, surprised and thankful. “I didn’t realize how much I missed this. It’s not just taking pictures; it’s finding meaning and beauty in ordinary moments.”
Naina’s smile was warm. “Exactly. And it’s amazing to see how it’s affecting you. You seem more at ease, more like yourself.”
Their photography outings became a regular part of their routine. Naina’s enthusiasm brought new energy to Aarav’s creativity. She often suggested new angles or locations, helping him see things from different perspectives.
One evening, as they reviewed the photos they had taken, Naina noticed Aarav’s growing confidence. “Look at these shots, Aarav. You’ve really captured something special. I think you’re ready to share your work.”
Aarav looked at the photos on his laptop, feeling a swell of pride. “Do you really think so? I’ve been hesitant to show my work.”
Naina nodded encouragingly. “Absolutely. Your photos tell a story—your story. I think others would appreciate it too.”
Aarav took a deep breath, considering her words. “Alright, I’ll give it a try. I’ve been so focused on what I haven’t done that I forgot to celebrate what I can do.”
As the days went by, Aarav started to feel a renewed sense of purpose. He took his photography more seriously, trying out new techniques and thinking about showing his work in a local gallery.
One evening at a café, Naina looked at Aarav with curiosity and encouragement. “So, have you thought more about sharing your work? Any plans?”
Aarav stirred his coffee thoughtfully. “I’m considering reaching out to a few local galleries. I’ve put together a collection of my best photos, and I think it’s time to see if others are interested.”
Naina’s eyes sparkled with excitement. “That’s fantastic! I can’t wait to see your work displayed. I know it’ll be amazing.”
Aarav felt grateful for her support. “Thanks, Naina. Your encouragement means a lot. I’m starting to believe I can really make something of this passion.”
Naina’s smile was warm and reassuring. “You’ve always had the talent. Sometimes, we just need a little push to see our own potential.”
As they talked, Aarav realized how much Naina had helped him. Her belief in him had reignited his passion and given him the courage to pursue his dreams. He felt a sense of clarity and hope that had been missing for a long time.
