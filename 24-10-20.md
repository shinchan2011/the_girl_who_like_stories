Hi!
Aur batao? Kaisa chal raha sab? SAI kaisa gya kl tumhara? Agar hamara pooch to ok-ok hi gaya. Sunil sir baar baar yhi keh rhe the ki copy kiya hai tumne lekin Chetan Sir ko kaafi pasand aaya hamra project. Par kya hi fark pdta hai, akhir me unhe last baar ki tarah hi marking krni hai. Ki jisko vo naam se jaante hai unhe acche grade aur baakiyon ko bure😔.
Chalo choro, baaki sb kaisa chal rha batao. Mere to kuch sahi nhi chal rha yaar, chetan sir ne itne marks kaat liye, pata nhi kya ho gaya hai unhe, 4 credit ka subject hai aur najane kyon aisa kr rhe. Aur baaki dusri chizon ka to poocho mtt. Rehne do yaar nhi krte in chizon pr baatein, sirf mann kharab hi hona hai inse. Chalo ek kahani sunata hoon.
You know when I was in my elementary school, I used to live in a flat on the front building of our school. I mean mere ghar aur school ke beech sirf 10-15 kadam ki ek sadak thi bass. To mai kabhi school ke liye late nhi hota tha. Aur har roz hamari classes khatm hone ke baad me hamare school ke entrance gate ko pakadke khada ho jata tha, aur mumma ke aane ka wait krta tha. Aur muuma rozz balcony me khade rehti thi aur bolti thi beta aa jao, aur agar darr lg rah to gaurd ko boldo vo sadk paar kara dega. Pr mai phir bhi nhi aata tha aur bolta rehta ki nhi mumma aap aao, sirf isliye kyonki merko icecream khani hoti thi dukaan se😁😁. Kayi baar jb vo mana kr deti thi icecream dilane se to mai sadak me lotna shuru kr deta tha. Mumma bahot khidti thi mere iss hrkat se😅😅.
Agar sach kahoon to mai tumhare baare me jo bhi kehta hoon, ya sochta hoon, unka koi matlab hai hi nhi, right? Kyonki dekha jaye to mai tumhare baare me kuch jaanta hi nhi. Like how your school was, aur tumhara bachpan kaisa rha, tumhe konsi jagah bahut pasand hai, tumhara bestfriend kon hai. Ye sab to phir bhi door ki baat hai, mujhe to ye tak nhi pata ki tumhe kin baaton se bura lgta hai, ya phir tumhara favourite food kya hai. Kyonki sbse zyada to yahi important hai na? baatein aur khana. Dekha jaye to mujhe jo bhi pata hai ya mai jo tumhare baare me sochta hoon unhe sirf maine assume hi kiya hai, waise schme hai ki nhi iss baat ka to pata hi nhi.
chalo chro yaar.
thik hai phir, baat krte hai kbhi aur

CHAPTER 1: THE BONDS
Aarav, Meera, and Rohan had been best friends since they met in college. Their friendship was strong and admired by others—full of laughter, support, and countless shared experiences. They had faced exams, celebrated victories, and navigated ordinary days together, forming a close-knit trio.
But beneath the surface of their seemingly perfect friendship, things were more complicated. Aarav harboured a deep, unspoken love for Meera. It was a quiet feeling that connected his heart to hers in ways he couldn't fully understand. This silent bond brought him comfort, but also pain.
Meera appreciated Aarav's calm and steady presence. He was always there to listen and support her without judgment. Aarav's quiet strength was a source of comfort for Meera, even if she never fully realized the extent of his feelings.
Rohan, on the other hand, brought a different kind of energy into Meera's life. His extroverted nature and enthusiasm turned ordinary days into adventures. Rohan's presence was electrifying, filling their lives with excitement. With him, Meera felt alive in a way that was both thrilling and comforting. Their relationship was passionate and intense, filled with ups and downs but unmistakably full of love.
Aarav’s role in their relationship was both supportive and painful. He was genuinely happy for Meera, but seeing her with Rohan—laughing, holding hands, and sharing private jokes—was a bittersweet reminder of his unspoken love. He had come to accept that Meera was happy with Rohan, and that was enough for him. Or at least, he tried to convince himself of that.
On days when the city outside seemed so lively, Aarav felt his emotions more deeply. He would often find himself lost in thought, replaying moments with Meera and the “what-ifs” that would never happen. He imagined how things might have been different if he had been brave enough to speak his heart.
One evening, Aarav decided to take a walk to clear his mind. The streets were busy with people enjoying the warm summer evening. He found himself at a familiar café where he and Meera had spent many moments together. He walked in, hoping a change of scenery might ease his troubled thoughts.
The café was cozy, filled with the smell of coffee and the murmur of conversation. Aarav noticed Rohan and Meera sitting at a corner table, absorbed in each other. Rohan was animatedly talking, while Meera listened with a smile.
Aarav hesitated at the entrance, feeling like an intruder. But before he could leave, Meera spotted him and smiled warmly.
“Aarav! Over here!” Meera called, waving him over.
Rohan looked up and smiled. “Hey, buddy! Join us.”
Aarav forced a smile and walked over to their table, trying to shake off the sadness in his chest. He sat down and greeted them. “Hey, you two. What’s up?”
Rohan began telling a story. “So, I told them, ‘If you want it done right, you’ve got to do it yourself!’” he said, his hands gesturing as he spoke. “And you should’ve seen their faces!”
Meera laughed, her eyes bright with amusement. “You always have the best stories, Rohan. I don’t know how you come up with them.”
Aarav sat quietly, enjoying their company despite the lingering sadness. Their laughter was both comforting and painful, reminding him of the love he couldn’t fully express.
When Rohan stepped away to take a call, Meera and Aarav were left alone at the table. The silence between them was soft but heavy.
“How have you been, Aarav?” Meera asked gently.
Aarav looked at his coffee, struggling to find the right words. “I’ve been… alright. Just busy.”
Meera looked at him closely. “You seem a bit distracted. Everything okay?”
Aarav forced a smile, feeling the weight of his emotions. “Yeah, just a lot on my mind.”
Meera reached out and placed a hand on his. “If you ever need to talk, I’m here for you. You know that, right?”
Her gesture was a small comfort, a reminder of their deep bond, even with his unspoken love. Aarav nodded, feeling a lump in his throat. “Thanks, Meera. I appreciate it.”
Before the conversation could go deeper, Rohan returned. The mood lightened, and they resumed discussing their weekend plans.
Later, as Aarav walked home alone, he thought about the day. The café had reminded him of the invisible bonds that connected them—shared laughter, unspoken understanding, and the quiet pain of his own feelings. Watching Meera and Rohan, he felt a mix of admiration and longing. Their happiness was intertwined with his silent sacrifice.
Aarav found peace in accepting his role in their lives. He was content with being a quiet supporter, cherishing the moments he had while carrying his unspoken love gracefully. The quiet of his room mirrored the calm acceptance he felt within—a silent acknowledgment of his heartache and the joy he found in seeing Meera happy.
With a deep breath, Aarav closed his eyes, finding solace in the unseen bonds that connected them all.
